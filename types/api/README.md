@hap-server/api
---

This package contains TypeScript definitions for the virtual `@hap-server/api` modules included in
[`@hap-server/hap-server`](https://gitlab.fancy.org.uk/hap-server/hap-server) for plugins.

If your plugin doesn't use TypeScript, you don't need this package. Just declare compatible hap-server versions
in the engines property of your plugin's `package.json`.

For API documentation see [docs/plugins.md](../../docs/plugins.md).
